Big changes in life usually require a high level of motivation, which is difficult to maintain every day.
To make change easier, we can break big goals into tiny, manageable habits that are simple to start.
These small actions are easier to repeat daily and can lead to long-term success over time.

M - Motivation
A - Ability
P - Prompt
I will place my running shoes near my bed every night (Prompt). This makes it easy to start jogging in the morning (Ability). Seeing them reminds me of my goal to get fit (Motivation).


### Question 3__Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)


Celebration creates a positive emotion that wires the habit into your brain.
When you feel good after doing a habit, your brain wants to do it again.
By celebrating immediately, you make the habit enjoyable and more likely to stick.

The idea that small habits add up like compound interest really stood out to me. Each tiny action builds on the previous one, eventually creating big changes in life. Ignoring these small habits can cause us to miss out on important growth.

### Question 5__What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book says our identity changes when we change our behavior. By adopting tiny habits daily, we shift who we believe we are. These small changes don’t require strong motivation but still shape our identity over time.

### Question 6__Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?


To make a habit easier, we can change our environment. For example, keeping the LinkedIn logo on my desktop reminds me to post and celebrate small wins. This visual cue makes it easier to follow through and stay motivated.

### Question 7__Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?


To reduce a habit, we can add friction to it. Logging out of Instagram and enabling two-step verification makes accessing it slower and harder. This extra effort discourages me from using Instagram too much.

### Question 8:__Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?


I want to share my skills more on LinkedIn. I will keep the LinkedIn icon on my desktop as a clear cue. Also, I’ll engage with professionals’ messages, which will encourage me to use LinkedIn regularly.

### Question 9:__Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?


I want to cut down my Instagram use. To do this, I will log out after each use and enable two-step verification. Making the login process harder will reduce my urge to open the app frequently.
