## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

#### Unwelcome Touching or Physical Contact  
Any intentional or repeated physical contact like touching, patting, or brushing that makes someone uncomfortable.

#### Sexual Comments or Jokes  
Making lewd jokes, comments on someone’s body, appearance, or dressing in a sexual way.

#### Displaying Sexual Content  
Showing pornographic material or sending sexually suggestive messages, images, or links.

#### Persistent Unwanted Attention  
Repeatedly asking for dates, personal contact, or stalking—despite clear disinterest.

#### Verbal or Visual Harassment  
Catcalling, whistling, staring inappropriately, or using gestures that are sexual in nature.

#### Power-based Pressure or Threats  
Suggesting job benefits in exchange for sexual favours or threatening punishment for refusal.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

####  Stay Calm and Assert Boundaries  
If you’re directly involved, clearly say that the behaviour is inappropriate and must stop.

#### Document the Incident(s)  
Note down the date, time, place, people involved, and what happened. Keep screenshots if it's digital.

####  Report to the Internal Committee (IC)  
As per the MountBlue PoSH Policy, report the incident to the designated Internal Committee or HR.

#### Support the Victim  
If you're a witness, encourage the victim to speak up and offer to be a supporting witness if needed.

###  Don’t Ignore or Dismiss It  
Ignoring harassment can allow it to continue. Every employee is responsible for ensuring a safe workplace.

####  Follow Up Respectfully  
After reporting, respect confidentiality and allow the IC to handle the matter as per PoSH policy.
